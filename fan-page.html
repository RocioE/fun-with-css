                        Bjork is one of the finest musicians we have seen in decades. Join this group if you enjoy her music and aesthetic. She was born in Iceland, and began singing when she was as young as 12. 
                        In the 1980s, she worked with a band called the Sugarcubes as their lead singer, but after 3 albums they broke up, and Bjork went solo. She was popular before in the Sugarcubes, but when she finally went solo, her career blew up. The world was enchanted by Bjork in her first and second albums.

                            Björk recorded her first solo album, a collection of cover versions of popular songs, as an 11-year-old music student in 1977. Throughout her teens she performed with various short-lived bands, ending up at age 18 with Kukl, a punk group that eventually became the Sugarcubes. With Björk as lead vocalist, the Sugarcubes won acclaim in the United Kingdom with their first album, Life’s Too Good (1986). After recording two more albums over the next five years, Here Today, Tomorrow, Next Week! and Stick Around for Joy, the band broke up, and Björk embarked on a solo career.

                            Never content to conform, Björk in 1997 released her most experimental works to date: Telegram, an entire album of Post remixes, and Homogenic, a studio effort with collaborator Mark Bell. Bell and Björk also worked together on Selmasongs, the score for Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark (2000), a tragic musical in which she also starred. The film won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival, and Björk was named best actress.
